It is the source of trust. The clone database is a PostgreSQL database installed on a computer, on another server, on a device (Android). It contains a subset of the schemas and tables of the central database. It may be dropped or recreated. It has been created by deploying an archive created with the QGIS plugin. Two-way synchronisation is done: between the same tables of the central and clone(s) databases having the same name and structure , only for the data of chosen tables in chosen schemas: no synchronisation is made on structure changes (adding a column, creating or dropping tables, etc.). Softwares # It is based on PostgreSQL and QGIS : PostgreSQL : a schema lizsync contains the tables and functions in charge of managing the synchronisation actions, storing the history and needed information on the central and clones databases. QGIS with a set of processing algorithms to help the user to: prepare a database for synchronisation, create an archive from database and deploy it on clones, perform the synchronisation. some algorithm allow to prepare a QGIS project for the field work. LizSync workflow # To start using LizSync , you need to: install the needed PostgreSQL structure in the central database prepare the central database : add the needed metadata , such as the server id add an uid column to every table to synchronise add the needed audit triggers for the same tables Before each field work campaign or when the table(s) structure has changed: create an zip archive , called a package , from the central database which contains the data and needed information deploy it to one or many clones Whenever needed: perform a two-way synchronisation from the clone by using the dedicated algorithm There is only one central database but you can have one or many clone databases . All these steps can be performed with LizSync plugin for QGIS, by using the dedicated algorithms in the Processing toolbox . Tip The plugin provides a right panel in QGIS interface which gives a direct access to the main algorithms . You can read the auto-generated documentation of all the Processing algorithms in the processing page . PostgreSQL database structure # LizSync uses a dedicated schemas : lizsync stores information on central and clones databases (uid), records every actions made on tables: inserts, updates and deletes , manages the sync actions, maintain an history of synchronisations Auditing changes # LizSync uses a modified version of the audit trigger tool to monitor the changes made in the central and clone databases. There is no audit schema created though, as every needed audit table and functions are deployed within the schema lizsync . The triggers names begins with lizsync_audit_trigger_ instead of audit_trigger_ . It allows to use the original audit trigger tool independently if needed. The audit tool stores its data in two tables : lizsync.logged_relations : the list of audited tables and their primary key(s) lizsync.logged_actions : the logs of every data modification made on the audited tables Each insert, update or delete triggers the addition of a new line in the lizsync.logged_actions table, with information about the time of the change, author, the type of action, etc. We added a new column lizsync.sync_data to the table lizsync.logged_actions needed by the synchronisation. It contains the unique ID of the origin database, and the synchronisation item key. We modified the triggers to fill in this new JSON column. Key features # Two-way sync : clone 1 <-> central <-> clone B <-> central <-> clone C <-> central Field granularity : SQL Queries replay only needed changes Manage conflicts : last date of edition wins (last person in the field) SQL based : run from any clone DB 1 SELECT lizsync . synchronize () Based on QGIS Processing : algorithms can be run in CLI if needed Unit tests cover the key features: installation, upgrade, synchronisation Demo # Read the reference page for some videos.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#what-is-lizsync","text":"","title":"What is LizSync ?"},{"location":"#presentation","text":"LizSync is a set of tools allowing to perform PostgreSQL database synchronisations between a central database and one or many clone databases: The central database is the full PostgreSQL database, containing stable data.

Renseigner avec le clavier Android le mot de passe geopoppy (en minuscules). Le mot tap\u00e9 ne s'affiche pas, ni aucune \u00e9toile, mais c'est normal. Une fois le mot de passe tap\u00e9, valider avec la touche Entr\u00e9e ou Suivant du clavier Android. Une s\u00e9rie de commandes doit s'afficher, qui d\u00e9crit le lancement des services: postgres : serveur de base de donn\u00e9es PostgreSQL, pour stocker les donn\u00e9es nginx : serveur Web, pour afficher l'application Lizmap redis : base de donn\u00e9es de cache, pour stocker les sessions php : environnement de script PHP, pour faire fonctionner Lizmap ftpd : serveur FTP, pour envoyer des fichiers sur la tablette supervisor : outil charg\u00e9 de lancer le serveur cartographique QGIS Server Un message final GEOPOPPY IP ADDRESS affiche l' adresse IP de la tablette, qui pourra \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour se connecter depuis l'ordinateur aux diff\u00e9rents services (PostgreSQL, FTP) Une fois ces services charg\u00e9s, vous pouvez r\u00e9duire la fen\u00eatre de UserLand , mais surtout pas la fermer. Utilisation # Pour lancer l'application Lizmap sur la tablette, il faut d'abord ouvrir un navigateur Web . Nous conseillons Chrome ou Firefox pour Android . Ensuite, vous pouvez ouvrir l'URL https://localhost:2080/lizmap/index.php Attention, ne pas oublier le s apr\u00e8s http. Une fois la page charg\u00e9e, un message d'erreur est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. C'est d\u00fb au certificat utilis\u00e9 pour le HTTPS, pour lequel il est n\u00e9cessaire d' ajouter une exception . Par exemple sous Chrome: A l'arriv\u00e9e de la page: Cliquer sur Param\u00e8tres avanc\u00e9s puis cliquer sur le lien Continuer vers le site localhost (dangereux) Vous arriverez alors \u00e0 la page d'accueil de Lizmap. qui est vide. Il faut vous connecter via le bouton Connexion de la barre en haut \u00e0 droite, puis utiliser vos identifiants OpenDFCI dans le formulaire affich\u00e9: Une fois connect\u00e9, vous acc\u00e9dez \u00e0 la page d'accueil , qui montre les cartes disponibles: Pour voir une carte, il faut cliquer (taper) sur une des imagettes, par exemple Espace de coproduction dans la copie d'\u00e9cran ci-dessus. Vous arrivez alors \u00e0 la carte choisie. Menu GeoPoppy # Dans la barre de menu de gauche, vous pouvez acc\u00e9der au menu GeoPoppy via l'ic\u00f4ne avec les doubles-fl\u00e8ches qui tournent. Ce menu ouvre un panneau \u00e0 gauche de la carte (ou en plein \u00e9cran en mode portrait), qui propose les actions suivantes: Test connection Ce bouton tester la connection vers la base de donn\u00e9es centrale, pour savoir si on peut ensuite lancer la synchronisation entre la base de donn\u00e9es du clone et la base centrale Synchronize database Lance la synchronisation bidirectionnelle entre la base de donn\u00e9es locale de la tablette et la base de donn\u00e9es centrale. Les modifications du serveur central sont appliqu\u00e9es sur la base de la tablette, puis les modifications r\u00e9alis\u00e9es sur la tablette sont pouss\u00e9es sur le serveur central. Synchronize media Ce bouton permet d'envoyer les photos enregistr\u00e9es sur la tablette lors de l'utilisation des formulaires d'\u00e9dition de la carte. Ces photos sont envoy\u00e9es sur le serveur FTP central. Fullscreen Ce bouton permet de passer la carte en mode plein-\u00e9cran, ou de revenir au mode classique. Pour pouvoir fonctionner, toutes les actions, sauf Fullscreen , ont besoin d'avoir une connexion internet, pour pouvoir dialoguer avec le serveur central (base PostgreSQL ou serveur FTP). V\u00e9rifier que votre connexion est stable avant de lancer les synchronisations. Trucs et astuce UserLand et GeoPoppy # UserLand peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le moteur de GeoPoppy . Voici quelques manipulations \u00e0 effectuer si vous rencontrez des soucis de fonctionnement. Utilisation du GPS # Veillez \u00e0 bien lancer le GPS de votre tablette avant de lancer le navigateur et de charger la page de la carte Lizmap. Ouvrir le navigateur et charger la carte Lizmap Dans le menu de gauche, cliquer sur le bouton avec un disque dans un cercle Un message s'affiche \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran, vous demandant la permission d'utiliser le positionnement: autoriser. Apr\u00e8s quelques secondes, la carte doit \u00eatre recentr\u00e9e sur votre position Pour d\u00e9sactiver le positionnement automatique , vous pouvez fermer le menu ou cliquer sur le bouton Arr\u00eater Relancer l'application Lizmap # Dans votre navigateur, si votre session a expir\u00e9, ou si vous souhaitez relancer la carte, vous pouvez cliquer sur la fl\u00e8che qui tourne situ\u00e9e \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du champ avec l'adresse. Cela permet de recharger compl\u00e8tement la carte. Red\u00e9marrage des services du GeoPoppy # Lorsque vous avez lanc\u00e9 le GeoPoppy, vous avez tap\u00e9 votre mot de passe, puis laiss\u00e9 ouvert l'invite de commande (interface avec un fond noir): voir le chapitre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent sur le d\u00e9marrage du GeoPoppy. Pour red\u00e9marrer les service du GeoPoppy sans arr\u00eater la machine virtuelle UserLand, vous pouvez encha\u00eener les op\u00e9rations suivantes: Dans l'invite de commande, taper le mot exit puis valider avec le bouton Entr\u00e9e (ou Aller \u00e0 ) du clavier.

LizSync permet le d\u00e9ploiement et la synchronisation des donn\u00e9es entre une unique base de donn\u00e9es centrale et un ou plusieurs clones: base de donn\u00e9es centrale : c'est la base de production qui contient l'ensemble des donn\u00e9es. base de donn\u00e9es clone : c'est une base install\u00e9e sur un ordinateur, une tablette ou un autre serveur. Elle contient un sous-ensemble des sch\u00e9mas de la base centrale Une extension LizSync pour QGIS permet de lancer les diff\u00e9rentes actions n\u00e9cessaires pour faire fonctionner cet outil: installation, pr\u00e9paration de la base centrale, cr\u00e9ation et d\u00e9ploiement d'archive, synchronisation. Sc\u00e9nario et concepts # Donn\u00e9es en base PostgreSQL # Une base PostgreSQL appel\u00e9e centrale contient un ensemble complet de donn\u00e9es, organis\u00e9es dans des sch\u00e9mas . Aucune donn\u00e9e n'est stock\u00e9e dans le sch\u00e9ma public . Avant de pouvoir utiliser LizSync , on doit d'abord l' installer sur la base centrale , afin d'ajouter les sch\u00e9mas, tables et fonctions qui permettent de g\u00e9rer la synchronisation. Toutes les donn\u00e9es relatives aux synchronisations seront stock\u00e9es dans le sch\u00e9ma lizsync . Les tables du sch\u00e9ma audit enregistreront les modifications r\u00e9alis\u00e9es sur les donn\u00e9es des autres sch\u00e9mas. Ensuite, il faut pr\u00e9parer cette base centrale , c'est-\u00e0-dire s'assurer que les tables \u00e0 synchroniser comportent les champs requis, notamment un identifiant unique (UUID), et que les modifications sur ces tables sont bien enregistr\u00e9es au fil de l'eau via l'outil d'audit de LizSync. Lorsque la base centrale est pr\u00eate, il est alors possible de cr\u00e9er une archive de donn\u00e9es pour un ou plusieurs sch\u00e9mas. Cette archive contient les donn\u00e9es des sch\u00e9mas, mais aussi les m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es utiles de la base centrale (identifiant unique). La cr\u00e9ation de l'archive est vue pour LizSync comme une action de synchronisation , dite compl\u00e8te. Cette archive est ensuite charg\u00e9e vers la base clone (vers un ou plusieurs clones), ce qui supprime l'ensemble des donn\u00e9es du clone pour les sch\u00e9mas de l'archive, puis r\u00e9installe les outils LizSync sur le clone et enfin charge les donn\u00e9es. A l'issu de cette phase, les donn\u00e9es du clone pour les sch\u00e9mas choisis sont \u00e9quivalentes aux donn\u00e9es qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes lors de la cr\u00e9ation de l'archive. Les donn\u00e9es des bases centrales et clone peuvent alors \u00e9voluer librement en parall\u00e8le, tant que la structure n'est pas modifi\u00e9e (pas d'ajout de tables ou de champs). Par exemple via une saisie de donn\u00e9es terrain avec des tablettes sur les bases clones. Une synchronisation bidirectionnelle peut alors \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer sur le clone les changements apparus sur la base centrale, puis envoyer sur la base centrale les modifications des donn\u00e9es du clone. Cartes Lizmap dans le contexte GeoPoppy # Pour pouvoir \u00e9diter les donn\u00e9es dans les bases PostgreSQL, il est possible d'utiliser n'importe quel logiciel: QGIS, QField, PgAdmin, des scripts SQL lanc\u00e9s manuellement, etc. L'outil Lizmap Web Client peut aussi \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour r\u00e9aliser ces \u00e9ditions: sur la base centrale , avec l'application Lizmap accessible en ligne sur les bases clone embarqu\u00e9es sur des tablettes, via l'outil GeoPoppy pour Android , qui permet d'embarquer l'application Lizmap en mode d\u00e9connect\u00e9 . Dans ce contexte GeoPoppy , il faut donc que les projets QGIS *.qgs et les configurations Lizmap *.qgs.cfg soient: r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s depuis le serveur central, par exemple via FTP adapt\u00e9s pour utiliser les donn\u00e9es de la base PostgreSQL clone de la tablette, en modifiant les informations de connexion charg\u00e9s sur le clone (tablette) pour \u00eatre consult\u00e9s via Lizmap L'extension LizSync pour QGIS propose des algorithmes qui facilient le transfert des projets QGIS depuis le serveur FTP central vers les clones. Installation et configuration dans QGIS # Dans QGIS, il faut: installer le plugin LizSync configurer les connexions PostgreSQL vers la base centrale et les bases clone Installation de l'extension LizSync pour QGIS # L'extension LizSync peut \u00eatre install\u00e9 dans QGIS avec le gestionnaire d'extension .

On souhaite exporter certaines de ces donn\u00e9es dans des bases clone , modifier les donn\u00e9es, puis synchroniser les modifications entre les bases. Les \u00e9tapes sont les suivantes: les outils LizSync sont isntall\u00e9s sur la base de donn\u00e9es centrale la base centrale est pr\u00e9par\u00e9e : ajout des m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es lizsync, des champs uid sur les tables, des triggers d'audits, etc. une archive ZIP est cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 partir des donn\u00e9es de la base centrale l'archive est charg\u00e9e sur un ou plusieurs clones , ce qui est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une synchronisation compl\u00e8te . les donn\u00e9es sont modifi\u00e9es sur la base centrale et les clones: ajout, suppression, modification une synchronisation bidirectionnelle est lanc\u00e9e depuis chaque clone lorsque les clones sont connect\u00e9s \u00e0 internet Choix techniques de LizSync # Certains choix m\u00e9thodologiques et techniques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour assurer la synchronisation bidirectionnelle. la base centrale stocke dans les sch\u00e9ma lizsync et audit les donn\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires aux synchronisations. les donn\u00e9es du sch\u00e9ma public ne sont jamais synchronis\u00e9es les tables doivent avoir une cl\u00e9 primaire de type entier, autoincr\u00e9ment\u00e9e . Cet identifiant pourrait diverger entre la base centrale et les clones. Il n'est utile que localement pour certaines applications (QGIS pr\u00e9f\u00e8re qu'il y ait une cl\u00e9 primaire enti\u00e8re) les tables doivent toutes poss\u00e9der un champ uid de type uuid (valeur exemple: 5d3d503c-6d97-f11e-a2a4-5db030060f6d ) avec une valeur par d\u00e9faut automatique. Ce champ est le pivot de la synchronisation.

La modification r\u00e9alis\u00e9e la derni\u00e8re (date de modification sur la base) est conserv\u00e9e, la plus ancienne est rejet\u00e9e. La base de donn\u00e9es centrale stocke quels sont les clones qui ont rejou\u00e9s les logs de modification, et garde un historique des synchronisations . Les conflits sont list\u00e9s dans la table lizsync.conflicts de la base centrale . Synchronisation des projets QGIS et des fichiers # L'application Lizmap du GeoPoppy a besoin de projets QGIS configur\u00e9s avec le plugin Lizmap . Ces projets QGIS peuvent \u00eatre des projets existants, mais doivent \u00eatre adapt\u00e9s au contexte du GeoPoppy , notamment les informations de connexion PostgreSQL, pour que les donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es soient les donn\u00e9es locales du GeoPoppy (base clone) et non les donn\u00e9es sur la base centrale. Cela permet ainsi de partir avec la tablette en mode d\u00e9connect\u00e9 (sans connection internet). Les donn\u00e9es visualis\u00e9es et modifi\u00e9es sont stock\u00e9es dans la base de donn\u00e9es PostgreSQL de la tablette (clone), et pourront \u00eatre synchronis\u00e9es une fois la connexion internet retrouv\u00e9e. R\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les projets QGIS et les fichiers depuis le serveur central # Cet algorithme permet de r\u00e9aliser la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des projets QGIS, des configurations Lizmap et des fichiers depuis un serveur FTP central . Ce serveur FTP est souvent d\u00e9j\u00e0 utilis\u00e9 pour publier des projets QGIS sur l'application Lizmap du serveur central. Tous les fichiers non pr\u00e9sents dans le r\u00e9pertoire de destination sont automatiquement r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s. Les fichiers qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s ne sont pas t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9s, pour \u00e9viter un temps trop long de t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement. Si la derni\u00e8re case est coch\u00e9e, les informations de connexion \u00e0 la base de donn\u00e9es centrale seront remplac\u00e9es par celles du Geopoppy : h\u00f4te, port, base de donn\u00e9es, utilisateur et mot de passe. Les projets pourront donc ensuite \u00eatre envoy\u00e9s sur le clone pour \u00eatre consult\u00e9s en mode d\u00e9connect\u00e9, puisqu'ils appellent les donn\u00e9es locale du clone, et non de la base centrale. Envoyer les projets QGIS locaux et les fichiers sur le clone # Une fois les projets r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s depuis le serveur FTP central, et adapt\u00e9s pour le GeoPoppy, il faut les envoyer sur le clone (la tablette). Pour cela, vous pouvez utiliser 2 m\u00e9thodes : Par transfert via cable USB Avec l'algorithme Envoyer les projets QGIS locaux et les fichiers sur le clone via FTP Transfert par cable USB # Une fois la tablette branch\u00e9e par cable USB \u00e0 votre ordinateur, le message suivant doit s'afficher: Autoriser acc\u00e8s aux donn\u00e9es de la tablette ? L'appareil connect\u00e9 va pouvoir acc\u00e9der aux donn\u00e9es se trouvant sur cette tablette : Cliquer sur le bouton Autoriser , Ouvrir votre explorateur de fichiers sur votre ordinateur Trouver le point de montage correspondant \u00e0 la tablette, et naviguer dans le r\u00e9pertoire Android/data/tech.ula/files/storage/geopoppy/qgis/ Vous pouvez ensuite copier/colller les projets QGIS et les fichiers r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s auparavant dans le r\u00e9pertoire Android/data/tech.ula/files/storage/geopoppy/qgis/ . Veillez \u00e0 bien avoir auparavant supprim\u00e9 les fichiers inutiles pour votre session terrain, et adapt\u00e9 les projets QGIS \u00e0 la connexion locale de la base clone de la tablette. La m\u00e9thode par connexion USB sera probablement la plus rapide, notamment si vous devez envoyer des fichiers volumineux (orthophotos par exemple). Avec l'algorithme \"Envoyer les projets QGIS locaux et les fichiers sur le clone via FTP\" # Cet algorithme supprimera les projets QGIS et les configurations Lizmap pr\u00e9sentes sur la tablette, puis lancera la synchronisation des donn\u00e9es.

Aucune donn\u00e9e n'est stock\u00e9e dans le sch\u00e9ma public . Avant de pouvoir utiliser LizSync , on doit d'abord l' installer sur la base centrale , afin d'ajouter les sch\u00e9mas, tables et fonctions qui permettent de g\u00e9rer la synchronisation. Toutes les donn\u00e9es relatives aux synchronisations seront stock\u00e9es dans le sch\u00e9ma lizsync . Les tables du sch\u00e9ma audit enregistreront les modifications r\u00e9alis\u00e9es sur les donn\u00e9es des autres sch\u00e9mas. Ensuite, il faut pr\u00e9parer cette base centrale , c'est-\u00e0-dire s'assurer que les tables \u00e0 synchroniser comportent les champs requis, notamment un identifiant unique (UUID), et que les modifications sur ces tables sont bien enregistr\u00e9es au fil de l'eau via l'outil d'audit de LizSync. Lorsque la base centrale est pr\u00eate, il est alors possible de cr\u00e9er une archive de donn\u00e9es pour un ou plusieurs sch\u00e9mas. Cette archive contient les donn\u00e9es des sch\u00e9mas, mais aussi les m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es utiles de la base centrale (identifiant unique). La cr\u00e9ation de l'archive est vue pour LizSync comme une action de synchronisation , dite compl\u00e8te. Cette archive est ensuite charg\u00e9e vers la base clone (vers un ou plusieurs clones), ce qui supprime l'ensemble des donn\u00e9es du clone pour les sch\u00e9mas de l'archive, puis r\u00e9installe les outils LizSync sur le clone et enfin charge les donn\u00e9es.

No data is stored in the public schema. LizSync tools must be installed in this central database with the dedicated QGIS processing algorithm . This will create a new schema lizsync in the central database, containing the needed tables and functions in charge of the synchronisation. Then, you need to prepare this database to add the needed metadata (server id in the table lizsync.server_metadata ) and optionally prepare some tables for the synchronisation: add a unique id uid colums (UUID) and a trigger in charge of logging the table data modifications (insert, update, delete). When the central database is ready, you can then create a package from the central database . To do so, just open or save a QGIS project containing PostgreSQL layers from the central database, choose the layers to export, and the zip package file path. This action is considered as a full synchronisation. The output zip archive contains the data from the chosen layers, but also the needed information about the central server and the tables which have been exported. This zip archive can be deployed to one or many clone PostgreSQL databases . This action will completely remove the tables corresponding to the exported layers, and replace their content with the one inside the archive. It also re-installs the LizSync tools in the clone database, which will delete all previous audited data. After this step, the data of the synchronised tables in the clone(s) database will be the same as the one exported at the time of the package creation. Data of the central and clone(s) database tables can then evolve freely, as soon as the tables structure is not modified (no addition or removal of tables or fields). For example, you can go to the field with QField installed in your tablet (or QGIS in your laptop) and edit data inside the clone database. You can then run a bidirectional synchronisation with the dedicated QGIS processing algorithm by choosing the PostgreSQL connections for the central database and the clone database. You can also run a synchronisation by running the SQL query SELECT lizsync.synchronize() from a PostgreSQL connection to the clone database. The synchronisation is a two-step action , which first gets the data modification from the central server and then pushes the data modifications the clone to the central database. Technical considerations # Requirements # Bidirectional synchronisation in LizSync is tied to some requirements: the history of synchronisation, data modification changes and other needed information are stored inside the central database lizsync schema. the data of the schemas public and lizsync are never synchronised . the tables to synchronise must have a uid field of type uuid with a automatic uuid as its default value. This field is the pivot of the synchronisation process , since it identifies each object . The same object in reality will share the same uid value across databases. Example of a UUID value for this field: 5d3d503c-6d97-f11e-a2a4-5db030060f6d . the tables to synchronise must have an auto increment primary key of the type integer . This id column will contain unique values in each database, but will not reliably identify the same object across databases . This means the same object could have a different auto-increment id in the central and the clone(s) databases. This id must still exists, as many applications need it to perform well, such as QGIS. The foreign key constraints must be based on the uid field of the parent table, not on the auto-increment id field, since the id columns can differ between databases for the same object. During the bidirectional synchronisation , insertions and deletions are first applied from the central server to the clone , and then pushed from the clone to the central database . This method has an impact for some scenarios. For example, if an object has been updated by the central database and deleted in a clone database, the update won't matter because at the end the object will be deleted. For updates, the modifications are applied only for the modified columns in the synchronised tables, which prevents conflicts from happening to often. When the same object has been modified for the same column , conflicts are automatically handled: the last update wins (the one with the more recent modification timestamp). Protect the lizsync schema and tables in your PostgreSQL database # You can protect your lizsync schema and tables by setting some rights on them, for example to avoid data inserts or updates by some users. For example, if you have a groupe of PostgreSQL role named read_only_group , you can run the following SQL queries to restrict access but keep lizsync working: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 -- Give the right to access the schema GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA lizsync TO \"read_only_group\" ; -- Remove the rights to insert, update or delete data in all the lizsync schema tables REVOKE INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE , TRUNCATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA lizsync FROM \"read_only_group\" ; -- Add the only right to select data from the tables GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA lizsync TO \"read_only_group\" ; -- Add the right to insert data for the conflicts table GRANT INSERT ON TABLE lizsync . conflicts TO \"read_only_group\" ; GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE lizsync . conflicts_id_seq TO \"read_only_group\" ; --Beware: the user must have the right to create a table in the public schema LizSync uses some functions with SECURITY DEFINER () to edit the data inside the tables. You do not need to give INSERT , UPDATE or DELETE rights for: logged_actions logged_relations synchronized_tables history The following tables have been created by your role when installing or upgrading the database structure with the plugin algorithms, so you do not need to give modification rights neither: server_metadata sys_structure_metadonnee The table conflicts must be given INSERT rights. There is not yet a SECURITY DEFINER function for filling it during the synchronisation process from the clone.
